## Description

I helped Amiko with her eager to contribute to open source projects, especially working on a web app that will search GitHub for open source projects with open issues and pull requests. As she created the HTML and CSS for this project, I added JavaScript logic to display GitHub repositories and their open issue counts based on a user's search.
